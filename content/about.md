## Whos this author?

I'm Nicole, a 2nd year student studying Bachelor's in Software Engineering (Honours) at [Wawasan Open University (WOU)](https://www.wou.edu.my/).

...thats the boring part of the introduction. Let's get that out of the way. To start, I find interest in many things, whether it be animals, technology, culture, cosmic existence itself... Whatever my brain thinks of in the moment, I'll get into deep dives about it.

At the moment though, I'm exploring and trying out stuff to figure out what I like and don't like. I plan to document my findings of whatever I'm exploring in this website through posting written articles on the subject.

I will try to update this website with as many posts as possible to keep myself accountable on my learning journey. To the rabbit holes I go!

**_Very important if you're an employer reading: I'm actively looking for an internship currently_**

## My Interests

Like I said before, its whatever my brain thinks of in the moment. It could be about jellyfish, how they look like plastic bags, why turtles think its plastic bags... Or it could be about the philosophical concept of free will, and whether its real or not, or only that we think its real...

As you can see, I am quite scatter-brained. One thought leads to the next. I've recently come to accept that this is just who I am, and my interests can be quite varied over time.

If you would ask me about my interests that are consistent with my whole life however, it would be some specific media, video games, and the world of technology in general.
