## Content Plans

There will be many changes to this website soon, content in particular. There won't be much to see at the moment because I've only just set up this website and deployed it using GitHub Pages. I plan to maybe write at least one or two posts a week about my learning journey in software development or IT in general. I might also write about other unrelated things with proper tagging in mind.

## Current website looks

Currently, the website theming is full of birds and the color blue. I may change the website aesthetics and looks in the future when I feel like it and have design ideas. For now, I'm going to stick with the bird photos.

## Keeping myself accountable

I made this website for several reasons, but the most important one is to keep myself accountable through writing posts about various subjects, but most importantly about my learning journey in being a software engineer or {insert related career name}.
