## What's new?

Only the homepage background was changed to the lavalamp background to make the site more consistent with the background theme.

The bird profile picture is here to stay though, since I couldn't find any nice photos to fit in with the site theming.

However I still haven't found out how to change the featured images, so I decided to remove them entirely temporarily.

Aside from those, that is all for this update today. This is not the end of course, theres going to be more modifications to the site soon. Stay tuned...
