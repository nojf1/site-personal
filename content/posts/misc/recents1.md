## A long time since the last update

I realised its been a while since I last updated the site. While I have learned a lot more recently, I haven't been in the writing mindset much so I didn't write articles since last month.

What I did learn recently was a new language, Python. Its an interesting language that can do just about anything, while being simple and readable at the same time. I'm fairly interested in how it can be used to automate things and build fun stuff. Its also a popular choice for AI and machine learning from what I've heard.

I also dabbled a little in the field of IT and cybersecurity. Its a lot more vast than I realised, and the rabbithole I inevitably jumped into gave me an overload of information I would have to use 5 notebooks to store in. Actually, from this experience I realised just how interconnected and interwoven each tech disciplines are with each other. The overlap is incredible, and I find it very interesting how all of this can come together to form the internet we know as it is today. People from the past would think today's technology like magic.

That said, it gave me the first taste of learning bash and powershell commands there. Of course, as a software developer knowing those would probably be good for the long run.

I've been looking for time to write more for this website, but I think I'm afraid I'm going to have my hands full for the next month, with a fairly large project I'm going to be working on that I can't say here just yet.

If I do update the next time, it would be maybe a few weeks from now.
