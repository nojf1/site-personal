I have finally done it, I've created the very first article in my 4 hours of configuring this site!

Naturally that calls for celebration, by looking at the time and oh... its already 2am.

That celebration would be of course, continue working on this website.

So far the worst of it was setting up the project. I think I spent at least 2 hours of the time spent since writing this article finding out whats wrong with the whole configuration of the site only to find out that I was setting up configs on the wrong directory the whole time... nice.

As for why I picked Hugo and the Blowfish theme, I have a bad case of decision paralysis when it comes to making something as personal as a personal website. I could spend at least 2 whole days looking at my options. Luckily LLMs exist and all I needed to do was ask what technologies to use for my website, and here I am.

I thought of using React, the good old HTML CSS JS route, or some other frameworks that would make my head spin more than it should... But in the end if its for a simple site with some blogging it would be best to use something like Hugo. Jekyll was suggested to me as well, but I chose Hugo anyway for the fast development times. It is nice not having to wait 5 seconds (which feels more like 5 years) every time I change something in the codebase for the local server to reload.

The bird photos and themes are just random stuff I found on my phone gallery that looks somewhat nice. Its more of a placeholder for now though.

This is officially my first brain-dump into this website, now I hope I don't run into anymore issues after this...

I should probably touch wood.
