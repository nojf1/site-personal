If you are not familiar with the topic, I encourage you to do your own research and form your own conclusions. If you are an expert on the topic though, please contact me if there are any errors or incorrect information here so I can correct them.\nEverything written here is extremely simplified, as the purpose of this series is to review my own understanding of the topic.\nI may write more detailed explanations on the subject in the future, which I will link to when appropriate.\nA (very) short history of JavaScript, summarised #\rBorn in 1995, JavaScript originally wasn\u0026rsquo;t called JavaScript, it was named LiveScript. Sounds like a foreign language, but make it a programming language.\nSince Java was popular at the time of its creation, it was named JavaScript instead, despite largely having no relation to the Java programming language. For marketing reasons, they say.\nOriginally, JavaScript was meant to add some interactivity to websites. If you knew what websites were like back then, they were totally static and had no way of interacting with the user. No flashy animations, no interactive buttons, no fancy menus, no form of complex functionality. But lets just say it was made as a very, very simple scripting language specifically for browsers.\nLater on, JavaScript gained a little more popularity when it was first standardized by ECMA International, giving the name ECMAScript. To put it simply, its just a set of standards to follow when programming with JavaScript. The point of this standard is to make sure web pages operate as intended and smoothly across different web browsers.\nAfter that, more tools and frameworks started popping up, and so JavaScript soon infected almost every website we know today. The thing that really made JavaScript soar in popularity was AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), which was popularized by Google who used them in Gmail and Google Maps. Considering how significant Google is in the internet space, the popularity spike made sense.\nFast forward to now, we have many JavaScript frameworks and tools to help us out now, with newer and better standards to follow when programming with JS. It will keep updating and eventually take over the internet I\u0026rsquo;m sure\u0026hellip;\nWheres JavaScript at? #\rFirst, lets understand where exactly JavaScript runs at. If you are familiar with Java, Python etc. you would know they have their own devkits you need to install from their official distributions or somewhere else.\nJavaScript is different. Its already in your computer as long as you have a browser installed. I don\u0026rsquo;t know any popular browser that doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with its own JavaScript.\nLets talk Google Chrome. As funny as the jokes about the Chrome browser being a memory hoarder, it actually has the best environment to learn, test, and develop with JavaScript. By default, it comes with the V8 engine when you install Chrome, which is a performant and open-source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine made by Google. Not only that, you have access to Chrome DevTools, which is super useful for testing and debugging.\nAll you need to do to access DevTools in Chrome is to inspect element. You can open it by right clicking and selecting inspect element, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + C (MacOS: CMD + OPTION + I).\nIn the console tab, you can start writing JavaScript there!\nAlternatively, if you want to write JavaScript in a proper IDE, like VS Code, you can do that too as long as its supported.\nVariables in JavaScript #\rBefore we dive into variables, its important you know about the many common data types in programming in general. I recommend reading MDN\u0026rsquo;s article on data types in detail here.\nBut to summarise data types, theres 8 to know: String, Number, Bigint, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Object.\nVariables are like those neat color coded recycle bins, paper for paper, metal for metal, plastic for plastic\u0026hellip; Every variable has their own role to play, but mostly to store data.\nThat recycle bin analogy is not that important though. Variables in JS are a bit strange, if you are someone whose first and only programming language was a strongly typed language like Java (take me for example). Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, variables are assigned dynamically, not static like in Java, where you need to specify a data type before assigning a variable.\nWhat that means is if you have a boolean data type, you don\u0026rsquo;t type this in JavaScript:\nboolean thisIsABoolean = true; Theres a few types of keywords you will use instead, one of which is var.\nvar thisIsABoolean = true; However, var is largely unused by today\u0026rsquo;s developers for various reasons I will not get into in this article. Alternatively, let and const is used as the standard for declaring variables.\nlet thisIsAString = \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;;\rconst thisIsAString = \u0026#34;Const can\u0026#39;t be changed after declaration!\u0026#34;; There is one important difference between let and const. Const, as you thought, stands for constant. What this means is that the data stored in const cannot be changed after declaration. If you try to do that, JS will politely hand you a TypeError error.\nconst thisIsAConst = 2;\rconst thisIsAConst = 9289484592; // JS will give you an error on this line Okay\u0026hellip; but exactly what are variables for? Remember that recycle bin analogy? Variables are simply containers we store data in, but they each have a purpose. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t need to specify the data type before code compilation, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to say that this recycle bin only receives paper, so we can in a way treat variables like smart recycle bins.\nNow with that smart recycle bin we have, we are going to throw a file into it. That file will be stored in that recycle bin temporarily, until its taken to be processed in a recycling facility. While its still in the recycling bin though, you can open the bin, look at whats inside the bin, and even replace whats in the bin, using the let keyword (remember you cant reassign variables with const!).\nAs for when does one use let over const or the other way around, when you have a variable that you think should serve as a temporary placeholder for, lets say, a user input name, you should use let. As for const, normally it is used when you know the value shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be changed, like Pi for example, or specifying the maximum attempts possible in a quiz.\nThat recycle bin has a name (variable name) and a type (data type). Now, to put it simply, we treat variables as a kind of temporary storage for certain data that we would need to use in functions, which I will get into in the next part of this series.\nSummary #\rVariables are temporary storage bins, used to store various data types. You can use and manipulate that temporarily stored data later in your code if you have a use for it.\nVariables have a name and a data type. It is usually declared using let or const. Let is used for variables with values that may change over time. Const is used for variables with values that should not change over time.\n","date":"1 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/tech/javascript1/","section":"Posts","summary":"A review of my understanding of JavaScript","title":"Let's learn JavaScript!

I think I spent at least 2 hours of the time spent since writing this article finding out whats wrong with the whole configuration of the site only to find out that I was setting up configs on the wrong directory the whole time\u0026hellip; nice.\nAs for why I picked Hugo and the Blowfish theme, I have a bad case of decision paralysis when it comes to making something as personal as a personal website. I could spend at least 2 whole days looking at my options. Luckily LLMs exist and all I needed to do was ask what technologies to use for my website, and here I am.\nI thought of using React, the good old HTML CSS JS route, or some other frameworks that would make my head spin more than it should\u0026hellip; But in the end if its for a simple site with some blogging it would be best to use something like Hugo. Jekyll was suggested to me as well, but I chose Hugo anyway for the fast development times. It is nice not having to wait 5 seconds (which feels more like 5 years) every time I change something in the codebase for the local server to reload.\nThe bird photos and themes are just random stuff I found on my phone gallery that looks somewhat nice.
