There won\u0026rsquo;t be much to see at the moment because I\u0026rsquo;ve only just set up this website and deployed it using GitHub Pages. I plan to maybe write at least one or two posts a week about my learning journey in software development or IT in general. I might also write about other unrelated things with proper tagging in mind.\nCurrent website looks #\rCurrently, the website theming is full of birds and the color blue. I may change the website aesthetics and looks in the future when I feel like it and have design ideas. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m going to stick with the bird photos.\nKeeping myself accountable #\rI made this website for several reasons, but the most important one is to keep myself accountable through writing posts about various subjects, but most importantly about my learning journey in being a software engineer or {insert related career name}.\nReport errors #\rIf you, the reader, notice any mistakes or bugs on the website, please contact me about it!\n","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/notice/","section":"Posts","summary":"Notice about this website","title":"(Not Very) Important Notice About Site","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"nojf1","summary":"","title":"nojf1","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/notice/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Notice","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/second/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Second","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"The second article to commemorate the creation of this website!\nAside from that, I just wanted to make this post to mention how proud of myself to have created this website instead of getting into tutorial hell of personal websites.\nThe style looks decent for now, but I might change it up later on, depending on my mood.\n","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/secondpost/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The second article","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/first/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"First","type":"tags"},{"content":"I have finally done it, I\u0026rsquo;ve created the very first article in my 4 hours of configuring this site!\nNaturally that calls for celebration, by looking at the time and oh\u0026hellip; its already 2am.\nThat celebration would be of course, continue working on this website.\nSo far the worst of it was setting up the project. I think I spent at least 2 hours of the time spent since writing this article finding out whats wrong with the whole configuration of the site only to find out that I was setting up configs on the wrong directory the whole time\u0026hellip; nice.\nAs for why I picked Hugo and the Blowfish theme, I have a bad case of decision paralysis when it comes to making something as personal as a personal website. I could spend at least 2 whole days looking at my options. Luckily LLMs exist and all I needed to do was ask what technologies to use for my website, and here I am.\nI thought of using React, the good old HTML CSS JS route, or some other frameworks that would make my head spin more than it should\u0026hellip; But in the end if its for a simple site with some blogging it would be best to use something like Hugo. Jekyll was suggested to me as well, but I chose Hugo anyway for the fast development times. It is nice not having to wait 5 seconds (which feels more like 5 years) every time I change something in the codebase for the local server to reload.\nThe bird photos and themes are just random stuff I found on my phone gallery that looks somewhat nice. Its more of a placeholder for now though.\nThis is officially my first brain-dump into this website, now I hope I don\u0026rsquo;t run into anymore issues after this\u0026hellip;\nI should probably touch wood.\n","date":"28 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/firstpost/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hello World","title":"The first article","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rWhos this author? #\rI\u0026rsquo;m Nicole, a 2nd year student studying Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s in Software Engineering (Honours) at Wawasan Open University (WOU).\n\u0026hellip;thats the boring part of the introduction. Let\u0026rsquo;s get that out of the way. To start, I find interest in many things, whether it be animals, technology, culture, cosmic existence itself\u0026hellip; Whatever my brain thinks of in the moment, I\u0026rsquo;ll get into deep dives about it.\nAt the moment though, I\u0026rsquo;m exploring and trying out stuff to figure out what I like and don\u0026rsquo;t like. I plan to document my findings of whatever I\u0026rsquo;m exploring in this website through posting written articles on the subject.\nI will try to update this website with as many posts as possible to keep myself accountable on my learning journey. To the rabbit holes I go!\nVery important if you\u0026rsquo;re an employer reading: I\u0026rsquo;m actively looking for an internship currently\nMy Interests #\rLike I said before, its whatever my brain thinks of in the moment. It could be about jellyfish, how they look like plastic bags, why turtles think its plastic bags\u0026hellip; Or it could be about the philosophical concept of free will, and whether its real or not, or only that we think its real\u0026hellip;\nAs you can see, I am quite scatter-brained. One thought leads to the next. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently come to accept that this is just who I am, and my interests can be quite varied over time.\nIf you would ask me about my interests that are consistent with my whole life however, it would be some specific media, video games, and the world of technology in general.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"nojf1","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rMy Contact Details #\rEmail: ojfnicole@gmail.com #\rPhone: +6 012-4709208 #\r*I am more likely to reply back on WhatsApp\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"nojf1","summary":"","title":"Contact Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
